query:			why food products or food contaminated wastes cannot be recycled?
passage:			Passage: Packaging. Between a quarter and a third of all domestic waste is packaging: much of this is food packaging. Itâs difficult to recycle, too. Plastic which is contaminated with food is hard to reuse. Glass bottle banks for recycling are now ubiquitous in the UK â and the material collected really is reused. 2 The average glass bottle contains over 25% recycled glass. 3 Green glass bottles manufactured in this country contain at least 60%, and sometimes as much as 90%, recycled glass.
