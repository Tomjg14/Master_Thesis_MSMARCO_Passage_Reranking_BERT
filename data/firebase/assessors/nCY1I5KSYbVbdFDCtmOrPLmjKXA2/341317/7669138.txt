passage:			Passage: Six Things You Didn't Know About Metroid's Samus Aran. The lore of the Metroid series tells us that the reason Samus Aran is such a bad-ass bounty hunter is because she was raised by birds. The ancient, dying sentient bird people called the Chozo took her in and raised her as one of their own after she was the lone survivor of a Space Pirate attack that killed her parents.
