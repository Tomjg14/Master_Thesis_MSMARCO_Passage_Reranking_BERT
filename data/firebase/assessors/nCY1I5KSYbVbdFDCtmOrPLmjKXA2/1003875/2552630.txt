The largest cluster is in the Mediterranean basin, but significant areas of this habitat exist also in South America, the western coast of southern Africa, California, and in the southwestern tip of Australia.arge animals simply can't stand the heat of day in many of these locations, and it's hard for a large animal to burrow.
