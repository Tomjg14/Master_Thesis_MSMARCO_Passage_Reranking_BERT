passage:			Passage: Other sources say that you can keep the fresh cooked sausage in the refrigerator up to seven days if kept at 40 degrees F (which is the normal setting in both restaurant and home refrigerators). Another says up to five days for cooked Italian sausage, lightly smoked sausage, or breakfast sausage.uncheon meats can also be kept unopened in the refrigerator for up to two weeks and in the freezer for one to two months, but the time in the refrigerator after opening is less than hot dogs at three to five days.
