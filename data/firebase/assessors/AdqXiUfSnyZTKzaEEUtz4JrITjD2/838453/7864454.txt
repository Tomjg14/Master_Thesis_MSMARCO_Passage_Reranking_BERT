passage:			Passage: TaylorMade-Adidas Golf, based in Carlsbad, is on the auction block. German sports gear giant Adidas, parent company of TaylorMade, said Wednesday that it plans to sell off its TaylorMade, Ashworth and Adams golf brands and operations as U.S. participation in golf remains stagnant.
