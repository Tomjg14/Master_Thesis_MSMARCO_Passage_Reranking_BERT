passage:			Passage: Cooking with Kohlrabi. If cooked kohlrabi is your aim, try roasting cubes or wedges in the oven. The kohlrabi turns sweet and a bit caramelized in the high heat of the oven, making a great side dish for steak, grilled fish, or almost any main course dinner. You can also stir fry bite-sized pieces, add them to soups, or steam them. In all cases, the kohlrabi is ready to eat when it is tender.
