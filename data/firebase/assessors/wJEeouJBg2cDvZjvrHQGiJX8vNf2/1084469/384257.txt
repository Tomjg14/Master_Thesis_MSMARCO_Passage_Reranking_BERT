Here, in South Africa, 'grassroots' has a particular connotation - appealing to the masses. I think the origination means what it says: from the bottom. Think of the roots of grass - do not really get lower than that. So 'grassroots' marketing would mean using mass market tactics to appeal to fundamental needs.
