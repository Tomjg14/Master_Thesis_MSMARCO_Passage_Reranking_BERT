query:			what is drop in baseball bat selection
passage:			Passage: Hi, James. A lower drop number for a baseball bat means it's a heavier bat; a higher number translates into a lighter bat. So, a lower drop number doesn't necessarily mean a better bat, but--depending on the player--a higher drop number could lead to more extra base hits and homeruns. Hope that helps.
