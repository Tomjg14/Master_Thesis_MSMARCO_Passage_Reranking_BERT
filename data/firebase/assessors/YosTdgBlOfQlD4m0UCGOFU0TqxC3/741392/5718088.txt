query:			what is drop in baseball bat selection
passage:			Passage: Both sports use bats, but a softball bat and a baseball bat are two completely different pieces of equipment. Neither softball nor baseball bats generally exceed 34 inches in length (baseball bats have a maximum length of 42 inches, though this is a rarity), but their weight differences are vastly different. In both sports, the difference between the length and weight is referred to as to the drop.
