query:			what is the empirical formula for phosphorus selenide
passage:			Passage: An interesting fact about phosphorus pentoxide is that #P_2O_5# is actually its empirical formula; its molecular formula is actually #P_4O_10#. The compound's name however was derived from its empirical formula, not from its molecular formula. The standard name for this compound is actually diphosphorus pentoxide. The di- prefix is used to show that the compound contains two phosphorus atoms and the penta- prefix is used to show it contains five oxygen atoms.
