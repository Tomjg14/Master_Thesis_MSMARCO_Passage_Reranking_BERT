query:			how many weeks can a yolk sac be seen on ultrasound
passage:			Passage: This all being said, seeing no yolk sac at 6 weeks can also be a sign of miscarriage. When you are faced with an ultrasound that shows no yolk sac, you will probably be told to wait for a follow-up ultrasound. The wait can be very difficult, naturally, but is necessary for an accurate diagnosis.
