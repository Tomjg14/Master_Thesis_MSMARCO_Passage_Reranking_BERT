passage:			Passage: The key is to take another state's bar exam-a state with a much easier exam and a much higher pass rate. You can do the studies on your own of states with high-pass Bar Exams. Compare it to your own state's exam. You'll have to study for that particular state's exam and arrange for your own travel and accommodations at your own cost, of course.
