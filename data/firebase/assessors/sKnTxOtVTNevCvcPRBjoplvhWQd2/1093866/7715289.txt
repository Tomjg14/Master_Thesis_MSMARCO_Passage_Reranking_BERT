passage:			Passage: Implicit Wait: Implicit as the word itself suggests is âsuggested though not directly expressedâ. So what I mean by this. An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available. The default setting is 0.
