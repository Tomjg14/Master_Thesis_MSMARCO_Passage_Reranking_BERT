query:			is thread.sleep implicit wait
passage:			Passage: So for example if we have mention 10 seconds maximum elapsed time and our condition is met at 7 seconds then script will not wait for another 3 seconds to start execution. In this case, 3 seconds of the time is saved. This is a major advantage of using this type of explicit wait over thread.sleep().
