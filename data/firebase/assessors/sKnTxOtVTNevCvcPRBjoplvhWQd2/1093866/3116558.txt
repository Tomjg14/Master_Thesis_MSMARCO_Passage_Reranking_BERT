passage:			Passage: Added Options#getTimeouts() for retrieving the currently configured session timeouts (i.e. implicit wait). This method will only work with W3C compatible WebDriver implementations. Deprecated the Timeouts class in favor of Options#setTimeouts(), which supports setting multiple timeouts at once.
