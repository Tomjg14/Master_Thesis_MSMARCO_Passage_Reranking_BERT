query:			what are sensitive periods for brain development
passage:			Passage: Many researchers now agree that the word âcriticalâ is not always appropriate. It is better to talk of of âsensitive periodsâ atleast when looking at cognitive development and emotional development. It is felt that the term sensitive period offers a better account of human development than the strict and rigid notion of a critical period.
