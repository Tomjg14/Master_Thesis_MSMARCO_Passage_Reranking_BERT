passage:			Passage: The Ideal Gas Law can be re-arranged to calculate the molar mass of unknown gases. PV = nRT n = mass (g) molar mass (g/mol) PV = mass (RT) mass x R x T = molar mass molar mass P x V Knowing that the units for density are mass/volume, re-write this equation so that it equates density with molar mass.
