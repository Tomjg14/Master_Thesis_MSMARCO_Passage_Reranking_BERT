passage:			Passage: Stuart W. Share. Nov 20, 2015. Divide the mass of a particular element by the molar mass of that element. Moles# = (mass)/(Molar Mass)#. You can find the molar mass of an element off of the periodic table. Since molar mass is measured in g/mol, dividing mass by molar mass cancels the mass unit (grams) leaving only a number of moles as your answer.
