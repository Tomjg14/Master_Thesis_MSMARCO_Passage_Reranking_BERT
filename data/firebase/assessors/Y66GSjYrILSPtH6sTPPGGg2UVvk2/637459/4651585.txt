passage:			Passage: After 18 F-FDG is injected into a patient, a PET scanner can form two-dimensional or three-dimensional images of the distribution of 18 F-FDG within the body. Since its development in 1976, 18 F-FDG had a profound influence on research in the neurosciences.lthough in theory all 18 F-FDG is metabolized as above with a radioactivity elimination half-life of 110 minutes (the same as that of fluorine-18), clinical studies have shown that the radioactivity of 18 F-FDG partitions into two major fractions.
