query:			can vcenter standard manage essentials plus
passage:			Passage: You throw out your essentials licenses, and rebuy everything (i.e. vCenter Standard x1 and Hypervisor x3-6). VSA is not part of the standard edition (unless you get a kit) so you would need to also buy a license for that. As explained by our reseller, you cannot mix essentials + individual licenses.
