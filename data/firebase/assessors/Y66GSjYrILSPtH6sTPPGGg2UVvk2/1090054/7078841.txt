passage:			Passage: Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically â2 mV/ËC for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor. Current steering
