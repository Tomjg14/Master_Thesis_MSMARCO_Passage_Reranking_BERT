passage:			Passage: Ideal Diodes. The diode equation gives an expression for the current through a diode as a function of voltage. T = absolute temperature (K). The dark saturation current (I0) is an extremely important parameter which differentiates one diode from another. I0 is a measure of the recombination in a device.
