query:			where does lice come from
passage:			Passage: For the most part, when the children leave the school, the lice also leave. Only rarely does a louse drop from a childâs head to a place where it could be transferred to another childâs head. Lice do not take up residence in school buildingsânot on the floors, carpet, books, desks, cafeteria, or playground. Whatâs more, lice are not capable of flying or jumping.
