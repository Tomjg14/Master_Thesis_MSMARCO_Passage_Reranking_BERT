passage:			Passage: Heart on my sleeve. Posted by ESC on May 20, 2000. In Reply to: Heart on sleeve posted by Bob on May 20, 2000: : Where does the phrase I wear my heart on my sleeve come from. I know Shakespeare quotes it in Othello but what does it mean and where does it come from?: I don't know of any uses before Shakespeare, but there may have been. Or... Will was known to coin a phrase or two. It means I do not conceal my feelings; my emotions (usually love and devotion) are visible for all to see. The sense also includes a feeling of vulnerability: when you wear your heart on your sleeve, you risk rejection and pain. From Brush Up Your Shakespeare!
