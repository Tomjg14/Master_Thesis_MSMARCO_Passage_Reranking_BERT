passage:			Passage: Warriors: 103. Cavaliers: 82. LIVE BOX SCORE. The Golden State Warriors evened out the series 2-2 much to the disappointment of the Cleveland fans. Cleveland fell to the Warriors in Game 4 by a 21 point deficit, by far the largest difference in score so far in this yearâs NBA Finals. LeBron James and MVP Steph Curry laid low and let their teammates do a lot of the work.
