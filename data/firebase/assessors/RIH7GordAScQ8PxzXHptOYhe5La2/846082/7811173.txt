passage:			Passage: Warriors vs. Cavaliers 2016 final score: LeBron James forces a Game 7 in a 115-101 win. LeBron James had one of the craziest, most dominant fourth quarters in a Finals game that we perhaps have ever seen. LeBron James forced a Game 7. The Cleveland Cavaliers will play the Golden State Warriors in a winner-take-all final game, but make no mistake, James is the reason why the Cavaliers won 115-101 in Game 6 on Thursday.
