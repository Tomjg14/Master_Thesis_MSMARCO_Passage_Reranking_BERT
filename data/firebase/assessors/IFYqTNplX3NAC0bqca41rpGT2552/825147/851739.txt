passage:			Passage: What Leptin Is. Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue (fat cells) that tells you youâre full. (Its opposite hormone is called ghrelin, which tells you youâre hungry. You can remember this because the word ghrelin sounds like a stomach growling.) Because leptin is secreted by fat cells, you produce more leptin as your weight increases.
