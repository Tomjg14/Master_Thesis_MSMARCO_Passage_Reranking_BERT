PBIL is a technique that combines aspects of GAs and competitive learning-based on Artificial Neural Network. PBIL-PSS was tested on a multi-machine power system and its performance compared to GA-PSS. Although PBIL algorithm is much simpler and easier to implement than GAs, it is as effective as GAs. Simulation results show that PBIL-PSS gives better performances than GA-PSS.","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":1.0},{"query_id":1091522,"passage_id":7907330,"ranking":4,"query_text":"population based incremental learning (pbil)","passage_text":"Here, we propose the population based incremental learning (PBIL) approach for characterization of a magnetic target.

This is a type of genetic algorithm where the genotype of an entire population is evolved rather than individual members. The algorithm is proposed by Shumeet Baluja in 1994.
