I recently saw some video's on youtube comparing drifting through the first 2\/3 of the corner and driving normally at the limit, although the variation of skills between the two drivers sometimes is under question... Does anyone know for sure which is faster, or whether a slight angle of drift gets you through the corner slightly faster? thanks.","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":0.0},{"query_id":408739,"passage_id":8839582,"ranking":2,"query_text":"is drifting faster","passage_text":"San Francisco Drift Gallery.
