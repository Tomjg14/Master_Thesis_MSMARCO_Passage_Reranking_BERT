At an optimum pH of 7.0, there are more molecules per minute in all amounts of substrate thus this pH is ideal for maximum growth. 5. Enzymes function most efficiently at the temperature of a typical cell, which is 37 degrees Celsius. Increases or decreases in temperature can significantly lower the reaction rate. What does this suggest about the importance of temperature-regulating mechanisms in organisms? Explain. Temperature is very important in efficient metabolic reactions. As we know, enzymes functions are important in all areas of an organism thus an effective temperature-regulating mechanism in an organism is crucial for proper functioning in all areas.","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":0.0},{"query_id":1089706,"passage_id":151503,"ranking":7,"query_text":"the temperature at which an enzyme functions most efficiently is the__ temperature","passage_text":"The best temperature is the temperature at which the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enzymes function at peak efficiency.
