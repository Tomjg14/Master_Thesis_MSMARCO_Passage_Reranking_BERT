Researchers refer to this time of readiness as a sensitive period in development. Sensitive periods open a window of opportunity where experiences have a greater impact on certain areas of brain development. During sensitive periods, the brain is most likely to strengthen important connections and eliminate unneeded ones in a specific part of the brain. Growth in that area is still possible after the sensitive period, but it is not as easy or automatic.","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":0.0},{"query_id":564668,"passage_id":6898704,"ranking":2,"query_text":"what are sensitive periods for brain development","passage_text":"With Otis turning two next month I thought it was time to refresh my memory about sensitive periods.

With Otis turning two next month I thought it was time to refresh my memory about sensitive periods. I know at two years he is in or nearing the sensitive period for so many things. But what is a sensitive period and what should we expect at two years? What is a 'Sensitive Period'? Through observation Maria Montessori discovered the stages of development that all children follow. She found that children go through very specific and well defined periods of interest in certain areas of their development.","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":0.0},{"query_id":564668,"passage_id":8126083,"ranking":3,"query_text":"what are sensitive periods for brain development","passage_text":"when is the most critical or sensitive period for brain development? the time when it proceeds most rapidly which is during the late prenatal period and early infancy. normal genes may provide rough guidelines about how the brain should be configured but...","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":0.0},{"query_id":564668,"passage_id":4461074,"ranking":4,"query_text":"what are sensitive periods for brain development","passage_text":"According to supporters of the idea of sensitive periods, this occurs because it is very easy for children to acquire certain abilities during a specific sensitive period.
