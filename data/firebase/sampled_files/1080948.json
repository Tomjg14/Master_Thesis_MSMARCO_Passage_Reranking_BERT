Histamine levels will vary based on the maturation process and the degree of freshness. The longer food is stored or left to mature, the greater its histamine content and the more problematic it can be for individuals with food sensitivities and intolerance. Fresh meat contains no or very little histamine. However, when meat is processed further, the maturation process results in the accumulation of biogenic amines. The same is true for fish. Fresh fish contains no or very little histamine. However, fish spoils very easily and this leads to a rapid accumulation of histamine due to bacteria. Further processing, which includes salting, smoke-drying, marinating and preservation, may increase the histamine content.","bm25_label":"medium","relevance_label":0.0},{"query_id":1080948,"passage_id":8745942,"ranking":12,"query_text":"what foods contain histamines?","passage_text":"This is called histamine intolerance.
