That is correct. Human cells normally have 46 chromosomes; this is the diploid number. Chromosomes are usually arranged in a karyotype, where homologs are shown side by side. This is useful for identifying some human disorders. In this karyotype, how many pairs of chromosomes are there? 46. No, try again. 23. That is correct. [HUMAN KARYOTYPE] Humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. How many of these chromosomes will be found in an egg cell? All 46 chromosomes. No, sex cells have a half set of chromosomes. 23, one from each pair. That is correct. 23, pairs 1-11 and one selected randomly from the remaining pairs.
