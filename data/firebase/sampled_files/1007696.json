EPSPs can also result from a decrease in outgoing positive charges, while IPSPs are sometimes caused by an increase in positive charge outflow. The flow of ions that causes an EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). EPSPs, like IPSPs, are graded (i.e. they have an additive effect). When multiple EPSPs occur on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, their combined effect is the sum of the individual EPSPs. Larger EPSPs result in greater membrane depolarization and thus increase the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell reaches the threshold for firing an action potential","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":0.0},{"query_id":1007696,"passage_id":2294739,"ranking":7,"query_text":"when a second epsp arrives at a single synapse before the effects of the first have disappeared, what occurs?","passage_text":"Temporal summation is the linear addition of graded potentials that overlap in time; that is, a second potential arrives before the first one from that source has finished.
