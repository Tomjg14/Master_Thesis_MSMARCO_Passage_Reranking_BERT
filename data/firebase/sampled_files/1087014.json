Ammonium nitrate is an odorless, colorless or white, crystal salt produced by the reaction of ammonia and nitric acid. How is Ammonium Nitrate used? Ammonium nitrate is an important component of many fertilizer mixtures. It provides a sourceof nitrogen to plants, which increases growth and crop yields. Small quantities of ammonium nitrate are also sold as an additive for mining explosives and other nonagricultural uses. What are the potential hazards? Under normal handling conditions, ammonium nitrate is not harmful. However, inhalation of high concentrations of ammonium nitrate dust can cause respiratory tract irritation. Symptoms may include: coughing, sore throat, shortness of breath, or even suffocation.","bm25_label":"high","relevance_label":1.0},{"query_id":1087014,"passage_id":5248917,"ranking":2,"query_text":"what are the hazards of ammonium","passage_text":"Fire Fighting Measures.
