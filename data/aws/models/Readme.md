# BERT MODEL

I worked with the pretrained BERT model by Rodrigo Nogueira and Kyunghyun Cho, who shared their work on their github:

**Passage re-ranking with BERT**: [https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4marco-bert](https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4marco-bert)

On their github they share a download link to a BERT Base model pretrained on the MS MARCO dataset:

[BERT Base Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cyUrhs7JaCJTTu-DjFUqP6Bs4f8a6JTX)

I used this pretrained model for my thesis, but I did not include it on my git because of the size of the model.

So click on the download link, or visit their github page to download the Bert Base model yourself.
