# MS MARCO Data

Not all data is included in this directory. Mainly because the files are to big.
I have included the small development set, which I used for my thesis.

However, to be able to work with anserini and BERT you will need the entire collection set as well. This set includes the passage ids and passage texts. So visit the github page of the MS MARCO dataset to download the necessary files.

To download the necessary files please go to: 

**MS MARCO**: [https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/)

Or download it directly:
